# Image-Augmentation-and-Image-DataSet-Generated-using-Keras
It is a simple function made using Keras library to generate a larger data set of images using a set of few images. The function to generate images is in 'Image Augmentation Generator.py'. It takes 3 arguments:

        1. k= number of images to be generated
        2.store_loc=Location/path of the directory where new images have to be stored
        3.og_loc=Location/path of the directory where images to be given as input are given

Images are generated by applying one of the 7 effects, selected randomly for each image. Further, each effect generator has a list/range of tuning, hence each image generated is different and unique. The 7 types of changes that can be applied are:

        1.Rotation
        2.Flipping (both horizontal and vertical)
        3.Channel Shift
        4.Zoom 
        5.Shear change
        6.Brightness
        7.Dimension adjustment/shift
        
The newly generated images are also further used to create new images in future iterations
Sample input images are present in:python_file_set/input_set Output images generated: 1000 images in- output_generated_set/output_generated_set.rar

Sample visualization of each image generator and image processing can be seen in jupyter notebook present in: images(jupyter)
